I've always been a man with a plan.
Always prepared never once to leave it to chance.
But it's all unscripted when I'm with you.
It seems familiar,yet it all feels so new.
All of a sudden I miss you.
Thinking about all of the things that we've been through.
Oh no it's not that I planned to.
But I think it feels like maybe I'm falling for you and me.
Just don't know oh were we ever meant to be.
Suddenly,oh you caught me,so off guard we fall in love so unexpectedly,so unexpectedly.
